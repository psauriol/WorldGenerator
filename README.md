WorldGenerator
==============

This program was an exercise in procedural programing for a hypothetical game.
It creates asteroids, comets, and other space objects.
Currently object created must be changed in the code itself.
Currently an asteroid is displayed.


The camara can be moved around with the WASD keys.
The seed to generate a new object can be changed with the C and V keys.
Objects can be zoomed using the mouse wheel (not centered).
